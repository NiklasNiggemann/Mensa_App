# Mensa_App

The official API of the canteen only provides a small set of data. This was circumvented by the creation of a web-scraper with the use of the HTML-Agilty-Pack library. 

The application implements the MVVM-Pattern - with the addition of a service module - and uses Source-Generation via the MAUI community toolkits. 

Features: 
- Tabbed Page with the different menus
- FlyOut Page with Overview of selected dishes and total price
- settings with a list of ingredients that can be marked as allergies
- marked allergies are highlighted in red in the menu overview 
- date of the menus can be changed
